        <br>
        <p>• My final project from the developer bootcamp. Me and two other team members conceptualized the project, split the
            workload, used github for version control and gave a 15-minute presentation with a Q&A at the end.
            <br>
            <br>• ‘Conglomerate’ is a ‘Social Media Manager’. It has a login page that gains access to the dashboard via parse.com
            (MongoDB). Once at the dashboard, you can access up to four different views at one time. They include ‘The Guardian’
            news feed, a weather app that uses your geolocation, a YouTube app and a Movie Database app. Ultimately gmail,
            yahoo mail, twitter and reddit will be added as well.
            <br>
            <br>• My role in the project was to ‘wire in’ all of the RESTful API’s, help build the YouTube and movie app, design the
            logo and aid in the design of the site. I used 6 API’s total: Guardian,
            OpenWeatherMap, YouTube, OMDB, IMDB and parse.com.
            <br>
            <br>• We built the site with Angular, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, Bootstrap, Onsen and LESS on the front-end/UI. We
            used node.js, ExpressJS and NoSQL on the back-end along with npm for packaging.</p>

        <br>
        <p>• My first paid developer project. I designed the site, took the photographs and wrote the code for a local therapists
            office located in downtown Birmingham. It went live in January, 2016.
            <br>
            <br>• It is a responsive mobile-friendly static site.
            <br>
            <br>• I built the site with Angular, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS.</p>

            presentation.
            <br>
            <br>• A graphic designer provided us with PDF’s of what the site should look like. We built the site in one week,
            even with constant design changes along the way.
            <br>
            <br>• My role in the project was to code the main page and then to go back and make the entire site responsive for
            mobile/tablet.
            <br>
            <br>• We built it with PlatypusTS (MVC), TypeScript, jQuery, HTML and LESS. It is packaged using npm & Bower with
            a package.json file using browserify, minifyify, nodemon, platypusui, stringify and watchify.</p>
